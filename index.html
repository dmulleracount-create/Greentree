            <summary>Who are we?</summary>
            <p>Greentree is a company which thinks that nature is the pillar of life. We have the common objective of planting new trees and to stop massive deforestation. We’re getting bigger, but for now, we are only a few activist volunteers</p>

            <summary>Objective </summary>
            <p>The objective of this company is to reforest and protect trees from other companies who want to destroy the entire forest for cellulose for making paper. We will start in small zones of Mallorca, Spain. As the years go by, if our project goes well, we will go to more zones</p>

            <summary>How are we going to have money? </summary>
            <ul>
                <li>We have the support of other companies (Araloa, ILUNION Servicios y Forescat S.L.)</li>
                <li>We will make a campaign for recollecting donations</li>
            </ul>

            <summary>Why are we going to reforest trees?</summary>
            <p>We are seeing that most people aren’t conscious about how important is to protect our environment, and how we’re killing our planet, so we think we have the obligation to divulgate and to make people know the actual problems nature has and what they can do</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>How are we going to do this?</summary>
            <p>We are going to start in small places with the help of other volunteers, as the company is growing, we will get some workers, and from each plantation they do, they win 0,20€. As this project improves, we will expand to more and larger areas</p>

        <details>
            <summary>Which problem are we solving with this project?</summary>
            <p>We don’t pretend to solve any problem with this campaign, but, at least we want to contribute a little bit to stop climate change and, more importantly, stop the big companies which only look for their benefit</p>
